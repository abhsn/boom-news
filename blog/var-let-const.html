          Differences between var, let and cost
        </h2>
        <p>
          A lot of shiny new features came out with ES2015 (ES6). One of the
          features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which
          can be used for variable declaration. The question is, what makes them
          different from good ol' var which we've been using?
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-3xl">Var</h4>
        <p>
          Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues
          associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it
          was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First,
          let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-2xl">Scope of var</h5>
        <p>
          Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use.
          var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. The
          scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function.
          This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a
          function block is available for use in the whole window. var is
          function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that
          it is available and can be accessed only within that function. Let's
          take a look into an example:
        </p>
        <div class="flex justify-center">
          <code class="bg-slate-200 px-6 py-4">
            var greeter = "hey hi";
            <p>function newFunction() {</p>
            <span class="ml-8">var hello = "hello";</span>
            <p>}</p>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          Here, greeter is globally scoped because it exists outside a function
          while hello is function scoped. So we cannot access the variable hello
          outside of a function.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-2xl">var variables can be re-declared and updated</h5>
        <p>
          This means that we can do this within the same scope and won't get an
          error.
        </p>
        <div class="flex justify-center">
          <code class="bg-slate-200 px-6 py-4">
            var greeter = "hey hi";
            <p>var greeter = "say Hello instead";</p>
          </code>
        </div>
        <h5 class="text-2xl">Problem with var</h5>
        <p>There's a weakness that comes with var.</p>
        <div class="flex justify-center">
          <code class="bg-slate-200 px-6 py-4">
            var greeter = "hey hi"; var times = 4;
            <p>if (times > 3) {</p>
            <span class="ml-8">var greeter = "say Hello instead"; </span>
            <p>}</p>
            <p>console.log(greeter) // "say Hello instead"</p>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          So, since times > 3 returns true, greeter is redefined to "say Hello
          instead". While this is not a problem if you knowingly want greeter to
          be redefined, it becomes a problem when you do not realize that a
          variable greeter has already been defined before.
        </p>
        <!-- let -->
        <h4 class="text-3xl">Let</h4>
        <p>
          let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it
          comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the
          problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-2xl">let is block scoped</h5>
        <p>
          A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly
          braces. Anything within curly braces is a block. So a variable
          declared in a block with let is only available for use within that
          block. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <div class="flex justify-center">
          <code class="bg-slate-200 px-6 py-4">
            let greeting = "say Hi";
            <p>let times = 4;</p>
            <p>if (times > 3) {</p>
            <span class="ml-8">let hello = "say Hello instead";</span>
            <p class="ml-8">console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"</p>
            <p>}</p>
            <p>console.log(hello) // hello is not defined</p>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          We see that using hello outside its block (the curly braces where it
          was defined) returns an error. This is because let variables are block
          scoped .
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-2xl">let can be updated but not re-declared.</h5>
        <p>
          Just like var, a variable declared with let can be updated within its
          scope. Unlike var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its
          scope. So while this will work:
        </p>
        <div class="flex justify-center">
          <code class="bg-slate-200 px-6 py-4">
            let greeting = "say Hi";
            <p>greeting = "say Hello instead";</p>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>this will return an error:</p>
        <div class="flex justify-center">
          <code class="bg-slate-200 px-6 py-4">
            let greeting = "say Hi";
            <p>let greeting = "say Hello instead";</p>
          </code>
        </div>

        <!-- const -->
        <h4 class="text-3xl">Const</h4>
        <p>
          Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const
          declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-2xl">const declarations are block scoped</h5>
        <p>
          Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within
          the block they were declared.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-2xl">const cannot be updated or re-declared</h5>
        <p>
          This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains
          the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if
          we declare a variable with const, we can neither do this:
        </p>
        <div class="flex justify-center">
          <code class="bg-slate-200 px-6 py-4">
            const greeting = "say Hi";
            <p>
              greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant
              variable.
            </p>
